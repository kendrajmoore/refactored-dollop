            <h2 class="cta-small-text-two">Moodefy launched in October 2019 to catalyze the interest in social and collective impact into action. While we recognize that personal aspirations may be unique, we share common goals for society. To facilitate this shift, we’re designing an web-based ecosystem that helps tackle the most common obstacles to realizing the changes we wish to achieve. We believe with clearly defined pathways and accountability toward shared visions, we can actualize the world that we all deserve. By transforming individual actions into collective impact, we’re committing to making our boldest dreams a reality.</h2>
